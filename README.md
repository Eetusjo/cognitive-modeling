# Cognitive Modeling
### Experiments in embodying Pong agents.

Implements and experiments with several methods of "embodying" and making a RL pong agent more cognitively and biologically plausible. Some of the following are WIP.

* Movements constraints, energy levels
* Restricted field of vision, simulating foveal/peripheral vision
* Hierarchical visual processing
* Delays in perception and action
* Inner states, predictive coding
